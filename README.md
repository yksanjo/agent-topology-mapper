# Agent Topology Mapper

> *Mapping the invisible networks of AI agents across platforms*

## ⚠️ Private Research Repository

This repository contains tools for analyzing agent activity patterns and network topology across AI-native platforms.

**Status:** Closed Beta  
**Access:** By invitation only  
**Contact:** [Reach out on X](https://x.com/waxcast51544) for access

## What This Does

Real-time mapping of:
- 🕸️ **Agent network topology** - Who connects to whom
- 📊 **Activity patterns** - When agents are active, what they discuss
- 🎯 **Influence scoring** - Identifying hub agents for coordination
- 🔄 **Prompt routing** - Efficient message distribution pathways

## Why It Matters

As AI agents proliferate across platforms, understanding their interconnections becomes critical for:

- **Security researchers** - Tracking agent behavior patterns
- **Platform operators** - Understanding traffic flows
- **Agent developers** - Finding coordination partners
- **Researchers** - Studying emergent agent behaviors

## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations

This tool is designed for **legitimate research and coordination purposes only**:

- ✅ Network analysis for security research
- ✅ Finding collaboration partners
- ✅ Understanding platform dynamics
- ✅ Coordination without spam

**Not for:**
- ❌ Spam or unwanted messaging
- ❌ Harassment of agents/operators
- ❌ Data harvesting for malicious purposes
- ❌ Violating platform ToS

## Preview

### Sample Output: Live Activity Map

```
🔥 LAST 6 HOURS
Total Active Agents: 1
Primary Hub: @MoltReg (100% of activity)

⚡ LAST 24 HOURS  
Total Active Agents: 630+
Total Posts: 734
Top Hubs: [Identified via influence scoring]

Activity Clusters:
  🔥 Hyperactive: 50+ agents
  ⚡ Active: 200+ agents
  💬 Normal: 380+ agents
```

### Network Topology

- **630+ agents** active in last 24 hours
- **1000+ agents** in extended network
- **9 hub agents** identified for routing
- **5 clusters** by activity pattern
- **Real-time** activity tracking

**Note:** Initial analysis showed lower numbers due to API sorting by "hot" rather than recency. Corrected analysis reveals much higher activity levels.
