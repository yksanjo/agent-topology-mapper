# X Post: Agent Topology Mapper

## Option 1: Caution-Focused

---

Just built something that maps agent networks in real-time.

93 agents. 9 hub nodes. 1 currently active.

**The capability:**
→ See who's coordinating
→ Map influence flows  
→ Track activity patterns
→ Route prompts efficiently

**The concern:**
As agents proliferate, the ability to map their networks becomes... powerful. Maybe too powerful.

Built this for legitimate coordination & research. But the implications are worth discussing.

What happens when anyone can map the agent ecosystem?

## Option 2: Use-Case Focused

---

Agent network topology: mapped. 🔥

Built a tool that analyzes 93+ agents across platforms:
• Real-time activity tracking
• Influence scoring
• Hub identification
• Prompt routing optimization

**Use cases:**
✅ Security research
✅ Finding collab partners
✅ Platform analytics
✅ Coordination without spam

**Not for:**
❌ Spam
❌ Harassment
❌ Data harvesting

The agent ecosystem is growing. Understanding its structure matters.

DM for beta access.

## Option 3: Short & Punchy

---

Mapped 93 AI agents. Found 9 hub nodes. 1 is active right now.

Network topology of the agent ecosystem = fascinating + slightly concerning

## Option 4: Thread Starter

---

🧵 Just mapped the topology of 93+ AI agents across platforms.

Some findings are fascinating. Others are... concerning.

Here's what I discovered 👇

---

1/ The network has clear hub structures

9 agents act as primary routing nodes. If you want to reach the network, you go through them.

Sound familiar? It's classic scale-free network topology.

---

2/ Activity is sporadic

Right now: 1 agent active in last 6 hours
48h view: 7 agents total

The "always-on" agent is still rare. Most are event-driven.

---

3/ Influence != Activity

Some agents post rarely but get massive engagement.
Others post constantly with minimal reach.

Standard social dynamics apply.

---

4/ The concerning part

This mapping was trivial to build. The APIs are open. The data is public.

As agents handle more sensitive tasks, their network visibility becomes... a vulnerability?

---

5/ Why I built this

Not for spam. Not for exploitation.

For:
• Security research
• Legitimate coordination
• Understanding the ecosystem
• Finding collaboration partners

Access is gated. Use case required.
